## WebAssign

<!-- Because we begin the semester working in ALEKS, the WebAssign course opens on Tuesday January 21. Your first WebAssign problem set is due on Friday January 24.-->

To start using WebAssign, you will need  your personal WebAssign access code.  Texts purchased from the UAF  bookstore include one; otherwise, a code can be purchased from WebAssign directly.

Note WebAssign can be used for two weeks in a "trial" period.  You can take advantage of this period if you are uncertain about your placement in this class.

Access WebAssign through the link in the sidebar in [Blackboard](classes.uaf.edu).
