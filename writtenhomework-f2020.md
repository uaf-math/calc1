## Daily Homework

Daily Homework (DH) is assigned according to the [weekly course schedule](assets/general/Fall2020/MATH251-2020-Schedule.pdf) (see tab at left).

By 8AM on the day of each class period where DH is due, students in the synchronous sections (FXA and FXB) should upload to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/153557) their solutions to the required DH problems. At the beginning of class, we will discuss three randomly chosen student submissions.

Solutions will be posted at the [Blackboard site](https://classes.alaska.edu/).
