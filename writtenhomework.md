## Written Homework for Spring 2021

Written homework is intended as practice in writing a 
clear solution another human being can follow.  Here's
an [example](assets/materials/Spring2021/SampleWrittenSolutions.pdf)
of what decent solutions would look like. Notice:

    *  Student Name, ID and Assignment all clearly labeled
    *  Each section/ problem number listed.
    *  Statement of the problem, perhaps paraphrasing.
    *  Clear steps or argument leading to the solution.
    *  Lots of white space.
    *  Final answer boxed.

Solutions are posted on [Blackboard](https://classes.alaska.edu/)
as they become available.
