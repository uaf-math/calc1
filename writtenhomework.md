## <span style="color:red">*THE PROBLEMS BELOW WILL BE CHANGED!!!*</span>

Written homework is intended as practice in writing a 
clear solution another human being can follow.  Here's
an examle
of what decent solutions would look like:

   * [Sample solutions](assets/materials/Spring2021/SampleWrittenSolutions.pdf)

 Notice:

   *  Student Name, ID and Assignment all clearly labeled
   *  Each section/ problem number listed.
   *  Statement of the problem, perhaps paraphrasing.
   *  Clear steps or argument leading to the solution.
   *  Lots of white space.
   *  Final answer boxed.

Solutions are posted on [Blackboard](https://classes.alaska.edu/)
as they become available.
