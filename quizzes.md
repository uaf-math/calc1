## Quizzes

<!-- After 3/23 in Spring 2020:  [Quizzes](quizzes) are now take-home.  Blank Quizzes will be posted on [BlackBoard](https://classes.alaska.edu) on Tuesday morning at 8 am (AK time).  They are due Wednesday by 5 pm (AK time), but we expect most students to complete them by the end of the day Tuesday.  No late quizzes will be accepted!  Students should scan or photograph or save their work as a PDF.  Quizzes will be corrected, but the grade will be assigned based on completion and effort.

Links to quizzes, and solutions, will appear here as they are completed.-->

Blank Quizzes will be available on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/153557) on Tuesday morning at 8 am (AK time).  We expect students to complete and upload them by Tuesday at 11:00pm (AK time).  You will have 40 minutes during that time to download the quiz, write your answers to the quiz, and upload the quiz into Gradescope. <span style="color:orange">If you encounter technical difficulties or there's an issue with timing, you need to ***immediately*** email your instructor with details.</span>  If you are writing your quiz on paper, you will need to scan or photoscan (using a scanning app on your smartphone), or save your work as a PDF if you are working on a computer or tablet.
