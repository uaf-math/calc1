## Quizzes

Links to this semester's quizzes, and solutions, will appear here as they are completed. 

Quizzes will generally be administered as part of your recitation section and retreived and submitted via [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/153557).
If you are writing your quiz on paper, you will need to scan or photoscan (using a scanning app on your smartphone), or save your work as a PDF if you are working on a computer or tablet.
