## Week 1 Logistics

In the first week of class a little different because we spend time reviewing precalculus material. Unlike later quizzes, the first quiz of the class will use an online program called ALEKS.  Here are the steps you need to take to complete Quiz 1.

1. By Friday, September 1, **schedule** a two-hour timeslot to take your proctored ALEKS assessment. In-person students will take their proctored assessment on Tuesday September 5. Online students must complete the assessment by Friday September 8. You can schedule your time by going to the link for your class.

	* [distance/asynchronous](https://ecampus.uaf.edu/exam-services/)

2. Take a proctored ALEKS assessment that will count as Quiz 1:
	* on Tuesday September 5 (in person)
	* by Friday September 8 (distance/asynchronous)  



## How to first log into ALEKS PPL.

If you want to login to ALEKS in advance of your proctored ALEKS, the directions are below. The advantage of logging into ALEKS in advance is to make things faster on the day of the assessment or to fix any login issues (like forgetting your password). It is not mandatory that you login ahead of time.

1. Go to the [ALEKS sign up page](https://www.aleks.com/sign_up) 
 
2. Enter our class code: **TJRQX-WJ49R**
		
3. ALEKS will then direct you through the registration process. **Write down your login name and password** as you will need them for the proctored assessment which will use a different computer.

4. Now that you have logged in to ALEKS PPL, it will give you a tutorial on how to use the interface and you are done with the set up.

NOTE: You will not be able to start your assessment without a password.
