## Week 1 and 2 Logistics

The first week of class is a little different because we spend time reviewing precalculus material. Unlike later quizzes, the first two quizzes of the class will cover precalculus material. In the second week, you will take a quiz using a program called ALEKS.  Here are the steps you need to take to complete your ALEKS Quiz.

1. By Friday, January 19, **schedule** a two-hour timeslot to take your proctored ALEKS assessment. In-person students will take their proctored assessment on Tuesday January 23. Online students must complete the assessment by Friday January 26. You can schedule your time by going to the link for your class.

	* [distance/asynchronous](https://ecampus.uaf.edu/student-support/exam-info-students/)

2. Take a proctored ALEKS assessment that will count as Quiz 1:
	* on Tuesday January 23 (in person)
	* by Friday January 26 (distance/asynchronous)  



## How to first log into ALEKS PPL.

If you want to login to ALEKS in advance of your proctored ALEKS, the directions are below. The advantage of logging into ALEKS in advance is to make things faster on the day of the assessment or to fix any login issues (like forgetting your password). It is not mandatory that you login ahead of time, but it is strongly recommended!

1. Go to the [ALEKS sign up page](https://www.aleks.com/sign_up) 
 
2. Enter our class code: **9A49K-R64C9**
		
3. ALEKS will then direct you through the registration process. **Write down your login name and password** as you will need them for the proctored assessment which will use a different computer.

4. Now that you have logged in to ALEKS PPL, it will give you a tutorial on how to use the interface and you are done with the setup.

NOTE: You will not be able to start your assessment without a password.
