## Week 1 Logistics

The first week of class is a little different from the rest of the semester. We spend time at the beginning reviewing some prerequisite skills using the online software tool called ALEKS PPL. Both the first homework and the first quiz of the class will use ALEKS.  Here is the timeline which can also be viewed in calendar form at the [weekly schedule](https://uaf-math251.github.io/assets/general/Spring2022/M251_weekly_schedule.pdf).

1. By Tuesday, January 11, complete an initial assessment in ALEKS.  This is a different process from the 
   UAF ALEKS placement test you may have used in the past. Completing this assessment on time earns you 10 points added to your Quiz 1 score.
 
2. By Friday, January 14, schedule a two-hour timeslot on Tuesday, January 18 to take your proctored ALEKS assessment. You can schedule your time by going to [this](https://uafmath.youcanbook.me/) scheduling site.

3. By Monday, January 17, complete 90% of your ALEKS pie **or** spend at least 5 hours in the ALEKS Learning Mode. Completion of the ALEKS pie / Learning Mode requirement will count as the first homework of the semester.

4. On Tuesday, January 18, take a proctored ALEKS assessment that will count as Quiz 1.

<span style="color:red">**Note:**</span> if you took a proctored ALEKS PPL at the end of your Fall 2021 math course, let your instructor know and accomodations can be made.


## Working with ALEKS PPL

Now that you have logged in to ALEKS PPL, it will give you a tutorial on how to use the interface.  When you are done with that tutorial, you will start your initial assessment.  This can take up to two hours, and is used to determine your skills and select appropriate problems for you to work on in the Learning Mode.  When your assessment is done, you'll receive a score between 0 and 100.

After your assessment is complete, you'll want to start working with the Prep and Learning Module.

You'll need to either spend at least 5 hours using the learning module, or complete 90% of your pie.  You can see your progress by clicking on Reports in the menu at the upper left-hand corner of the learning module screen.

## Sign up

Go to the YouCanBookMe scheduler to choose a two-hour block. The assessment will be in Chapman Hall (Room 106 or Room 103 depending on the session).
