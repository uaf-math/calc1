## Week 1 Logistics

The first week of class is a little different from the rest of the semester. We spend time at the beginning reviewing some prerequisite skills using the online software tool called ALEKS PPL. Both the first homework and the first quiz of the class will use ALEKS.  Here is the timeline which can also be viewed in calendar form at the [weekly schedule](https://uaf-math251.github.io/assets/general/Spring2022/M251_weekly_schedule.pdf).

1. By Tuesday, August 30, complete an initial assessment in ALEKS. Note that in-person students will get do this in Recitation. Completing this assessment on time earns you 10 points added to your Quiz 1 score.
 
2. By Friday, September 2, schedule a two-hour timeslot to take your proctored ALEKS assessment. In-person students will take their proctored assessment on Tuesday September 6. Online students must complete the assessment by Friday September 9. You can schedule your time by going to the link for your class.

## Working with ALEKS PPL

Now that you have logged in to ALEKS PPL, it will give you a tutorial on how to use the interface.  When you are done with that tutorial, you will start your initial assessment.  This can take up to two hours, and is used to determine your skills and select appropriate problems for you to work on in the Learning Mode.  When your assessment is done, you'll receive a score between 0 and 100.

After your assessment is complete, you'll want to start working with the Prep and Learning Module.

You'll need to either spend at least 5 hours using the learning module, or complete 90% of your pie.  You can see your progress by clicking on Reports in the menu at the upper left-hand corner of the learning module screen.
