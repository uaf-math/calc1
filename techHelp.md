# Technology Help

Because everything is offered by distance, we are using *a lot* of technology. Here's an overview of the technology we're using, along with some commentary.

* [Classtime](classtime)
* [Homework and Assessment](homework-and-assessment)
* [Scanning](scanning)
* [Printing](printing)
* [Discord](discord)

## Classtime 

* [Blackboard](classes.uaf.edu) is UAF's Learning Management System. This is where we will store everything that needs to be password protected (such as your grades). It's also where you can find the link to the classtime Zoom sessions.

* Classtime for the synchronous sections happens over [Zoom](zoom.us). 

	- I find that Zoom works better using a [Zoom](zoom.us) client (not the browser), and I strongly encourage you to use Zoom on a computer, if possible. It is much easier to raise your Zoom hand and interact with your classmates, post reactions, etc., than on a smartphone or tablet.
	
## Homework and Assessment

* WebAssign
	- Double-check the Class Key, posted [here](webassign)
	- Check the [WebAssign Quick Start Guide](https://www.webassign.net/manual/WA_Student_Quick_Start.pdf)
	- Check the [WebAssign Manual](https://www.webassign.net/manual/student_guide/introduction.htm).
	- Cengage has [customer support](support.cengage.com), or phone 800.354.9706 (likely to be super busy at the beginning of the semester).
	
* Quizzes and Daily Homework will be uploaded through [Gradescope](www.gradescope.com).
	- Log in to Gradescope using your "school credentials": this will let you use the UAF Single Sign On.
	- If your file takes a long time to upload, make sure your scan is not too big. I recommend using black-and-white scans (unless you are using color in your work, in which case please use color scans) made through a dedicated smartphone scanning app (see below) rather than just trying to upload a photo. 
	- If you are working on an iPad, I have had students somehow use some unknown app that makes *huge* files. Double-check your file size if you're having difficulties. Leah can help troubleshoot iPad stuff.
	- Don't just print to pdf; usually computers or applications have export to pdf options that produce more optimized files.

## Scanning
	
* Use your smartphone to scan: I recommend [GeniusScan](https://thegrizzlylabs.com/genius-scan/). The (free) basic version should be fine. Works nicely for both iPhone and Android. When possible, set your scans to black-and-white, so that they are smaller and therefore easier to upload.
	- Click the orange + button to start a scan
	- in the upper right, you can toggle between single and batch (for multipage scans)
	- Usually it's pretty good at choosing, but to force black-and-white, go to the settings gear, select "Default Filter" and you can select either black-and-white or color.
	- Sometimes students find it's helpful to tack up work vertically (say, on a refrigerator) to avoid glare
	- *Double-check your scan* before you upload it, to make sure it's readable!

* If you're using a dedicated scanner, follow the instructions. Then check your scan.

## Printing 

* UAF Printers: [this page](https://www.alaska.edu/files/oit/services/printing_support/Pharos-Setup.pdf) has information from UAF OIT about student printing, including how to access but I don't know how up-to-date it is.

In addition, there is a student-accessible printer in the Chapman Computer Lab (CHAP 103). You will need to swipe your PolarExpress card at the Student Printer in order to print, and there will be a charge (you will use your Bear Bucks to pay for printing).

### No printer?
* If you absolutely can not get access to a printer and you have a time crunch, you can write up the solutions to your quiz in roughly the right place on a separate piece of paper and scan and upload it to Gradescope. You need to make sure you have at least as many pages uploaded as the quiz has. Then email your instructor and explain what's going on.

## Discord

The CS students are running a discord server where you can chat/ask questions about our Calculus class (and other math and CS classes)! I encourage you all to join (if you've not already), ask questions, and see what your classmates are asking. I will answer questions there, as well as by email, office hours, etc.

From the admins:

- The join link for the discord is here: [www.cs.uaf.edu/chat](www.cs.uaf.edu/chat) . We ask that you set your nickname on the server to your full preferred name, and then we will move you into the server and you can join classes.
- Here are some directions for joining the Calculus I class chat on the server:
	-There is a chat channel called nookbot-den and it is a way for students to pick what class chats to join.
	- After clicking on the nookbot-den channel you should enter this command to join the Calc I class chat:
	
	!joinclass calculus1
	
after that you will see all chat history for the Calculus I channel. It includes all chat history from the current semester, so you have not missed out on anything!
- If you are having issues or need help you can tag an admin with the @admin and a message to ask for help!
