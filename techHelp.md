# Technology Help

Because everything is offered by distance, we are using *a lot* of technology. Here's an overview of the technology we're using, along with some commentary.

* [Classtime](#classtime)
* [Homework and Assessment](#homework-and-assessment)
* [Scanning](#scanning)
* [Printing](#printing)
* [Discord](#discord)

## Classtime 

* [Blackboard](http://classes.uaf.edu) is UAF's Learning Management System. This is where we will store everything that needs to be password protected (such as your grades). It's also where you can find the link to the classtime Zoom sessions.

* Classtime for the synchronous sections happens over [Zoom](zoom.us). 

	- I find that Zoom works better using a [Zoom](zoom.us) client (not the browser), and I strongly encourage you to use Zoom on a computer, if possible. It is much easier to raise your Zoom hand and interact with your classmates, post reactions, etc., than on a smartphone or tablet.
	
* Headphones
	
	- If you are planning on accessing zoom class in public spaces, I suggest you use headphones with a microphone so that you are not bothering people around you.	
	
## Homework and Assessment

* WebAssign
	- Log in to Webassign through the link in Blackboard.
	- Check the [WebAssign Quick Start Guide](https://www.webassign.net/manual/WA_Student_Quick_Start.pdf)
	- Check the [WebAssign Manual](https://www.webassign.net/manual/student_guide/introduction.htm).
	- Cengage has [customer support](support.cengage.com), or phone 800.354.9706 (likely to be super busy at the beginning of the semester).
	
* Quizzes and Daily Homework will be uploaded through [Gradescope](http://www.gradescope.com).
	- Log in to Gradescope using your "school credentials": this will let you use the UAF Single Sign On.
	- If your file takes a long time to upload, make sure your scan is not too big. I recommend using black-and-white scans (unless you are using color in your work, in which case please use color scans) made through a dedicated smartphone scanning app (see below) rather than just trying to upload a photo. 
	- If you are working on an iPad, I have had students somehow use some unknown app that makes *huge* files. Double-check your file size if you're having difficulties. Leah can help troubleshoot iPad stuff.
	- Don't just print to pdf; usually computers or applications have export to pdf options that produce more optimized files.
	- Gradescope has a [guide to submitting homework](https://gradescope-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/help/submitting_hw_guide.pdf).

## Scanning
	
* Use your smartphone to scan: I recommend [GeniusScan](https://thegrizzlylabs.com/genius-scan/). The (free) basic version should be fine. Works nicely for both iPhone and Android. When possible, set your scans to black-and-white, so that they are smaller and therefore easier to upload.
	- Click the orange + button to start a scan
	- in the upper right, you can toggle between single and batch (for multipage scans)
	- Usually it's pretty good at choosing, but to force black-and-white, go to the settings gear, select "Default Filter" and you can select either black-and-white or color.
	- Sometimes students find it's helpful to tack up work vertically (say, on a refrigerator) to avoid glare
	- *Double-check your scan* before you upload it, to make sure it's readable!

* If you're using a dedicated scanner, follow the instructions. Then check your scan.

## Printing 

* UAF Printers: [this page](https://www.alaska.edu/files/oit/services/printing_support/Pharos-Setup.pdf) has information from UAF OIT about student printing, including how to access but I don't know how up-to-date it is.

In addition, there is a student-accessible printer in the Chapman Computer Lab (CHAP 103). You will need to swipe your PolarExpress card at the Student Printer in order to print, and there will be a charge (you will use your Bear Bucks to pay for printing).

#### No printer?
* If you absolutely can not get access to a printer and you have a time crunch, you can write up the solutions to your quiz in roughly the right place on a separate piece of paper and scan and upload it to Gradescope. You need to make sure you have at least as many pages uploaded as the quiz has. Then email your instructor and explain what's going on.

## Discord

The CS students are running a discord server where you can chat/ask questions about our Calculus class (and other math and CS classes)! I encourage you all to join (if you've not already), ask questions, and see what your classmates are asking. I will answer questions there, as well as by email, office hours, etc.

From the admins:

To get started visit, [https://nookbot.katlyn.dev/](https://nookbot.katlyn.dev/) and login with your UA account (they do not see your password). From there, you will be presented with the list of Math courses. Select the one(s) you want to join by checking the box. There is no need to hit a submit or ok button since it is all updated live.  The system will have you sign into Discord too, so we know what Discord user to update.  If you don’t have a Discord account, then it will also set one up for you.

- If you are having issues or need help you can tag an admin with the @admin and a message to ask for help!
