# Technology Help

Because everything is offered by distance, we are using *a lot* of technology. 

* [Classtime](#classtime)
* [Homework and Assessment](#homework-and-assessment)
* [Scanning](#scanning)
* [Printing](#printing)
* [Discord](#discord)

- - - 

## Classtime 

* [Blackboard](http://classes.uaf.edu) is UAF's Learning Management System. This is where we will store everything that needs to be password protected (such as your grades and links to the classtime Zoom sessions).

* Classtime for the synchronous sections happens over [Zoom](zoom.us). 

	-  Zoom works better using a [Zoom](zoom.us) client (not the browser).  Using a laptop or desktop will make it easier for you to participate than using a smartphone or tablet.
	- Please make sure that you are running the latest version of Zoom. If you need help contact OIT at 907-450-8300 option 1, or email ua-video@alaska.edu
		
## Homework and Assessment

* WebAssign
	- Cengage has [customer support](support.cengage.com), or phone 800.354.9706 (likely to be super busy at the beginning of the semester).
	
* Quizzes and Daily Homework will be uploaded through [Gradescope]({{site.data.general.gradescope}}).
	- Log in to Gradescope using your "school credentials": this will let you use the UAF Single Sign On.
	- If your file takes a long time to upload, make sure your scan is not too big. I recommend using black-and-white scans (unless you are using color in your work, in which case please use color scans) made through a dedicated smartphone scanning app (see below) rather than just trying to upload a photo. 
	- Don't just print to pdf; usually computers or applications have export to pdf options that produce more optimized files.
	- Gradescope has a [guide to submitting homework](https://gradescope-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/help/submitting_hw_guide.pdf).

## Scanning
	
* Use your smartphone to scan: [GeniusScan](https://thegrizzlylabs.com/genius-scan/) is a good choice. The (free) basic version should be fine. Works nicely for both iPhone and Android. When possible, set your scans to black-and-white, so that they are smaller and therefore easier to upload.
	- Click the orange + button to start a scan
	- in the upper right, you can toggle between single and batch (for multipage scans). For assignments with multiple pages, you will need to take a multiple-page scan (Gradescope expects you to upload a single PDF for a given assignment).
	- Usually it's pretty good at choosing, but to force black-and-white, go to the settings gear, select "Default Filter" and you can select either black-and-white or color.
	- Sometimes students find it's helpful to tack up work vertically (say, on a refrigerator) to avoid glare
	- *Double-check your scan* before you upload it, to make sure it's readable!

* If you're using a dedicated scanner, follow the instructions. Then check your scan.

## Printing 

* UAF Printers: [this page](https://www.alaska.edu/files/oit/services/printing_support/Pharos-Setup.pdf) has information from UAF OIT about student printing, including how to access but I don't know how up-to-date it is.

In addition, there is a student-accessible printer in the Chapman Computer Lab (CHAP 103). You will need to swipe your PolarExpress card at the Student Printer in order to print, and there will be a charge (you will use your Bear Bucks to pay for printing).

#### No printer?
* If you absolutely can not get access to a printer and you have a time crunch, you can write up the solutions to your quiz in roughly the right place on a separate piece of paper and scan and upload it to Gradescope. You need to make sure you have at least as many pages uploaded as the quiz has. Then email your instructor and explain what's going on.

## Discord

The CS students are running a discord server where you can chat/ask questions about our Calculus class (and other math and CS classes)! I encourage you all to join (if you've not already), ask questions, and see what your classmates are asking. I will answer questions there, as well as by email, office hours, etc.

From the admins:

To get started visit, [https://nookbot.katlyn.dev/](https://nookbot.katlyn.dev/) and login with your UA account (they do not see your password). From there, you will be presented with the list of Math courses. Select the one(s) you want to join by checking the box. There is no need to hit a submit or ok button since it is all updated live.  The system will have you sign into Discord too, so we know what Discord user to update.  If you donâ€™t have a Discord account, then it will also set one up for you.

The server (which is called UAF-CS) should be available to you any time you log into Discord. Discord is available at [https://discord.com](https://discord.com), and there's also an app for computer and for smartphone. Once you're logged in, click on the channel that has a picture of the UAF logo, and then on the right-hand side there's a section you can expand called Math, and then our class should be there.

- If you are having issues or need help you can tag an admin with the @admin and a message to ask for help!
