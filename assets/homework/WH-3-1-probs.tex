\item{(Problem A)} This is a continuation of \#46 above where you used average velocity over smaller and smaller intervals to guess the instantaneous velocity of a ball at $t=5$ seconds. Use equation 3.6 from your book to confirm your guess. (That is, use equation 3.6 to find $s'(5)=v(5)$ for the function $s(t)=14t^2.$

\item{(Problem B)} The population of fruit flies in a compost bin is modeled by the the function $P(t)=4\sqrt{t+1}$ where $t$ is measured in weeks and $P$ is measured in hundreds of fruit flies. Use equation 3.6 to find $P'(3)$ and \emph{interpret} your answer. Include units.

\item{(Problem C)} A company models its profit by a function $P(x)$ where $x$ is the number of widgets produced and sold and $P$ is the profit in thousands of dollars for selling $x$ widgets. The company finds that $P'(100,000)=-50.$ What should the company conclude from this calculation?
