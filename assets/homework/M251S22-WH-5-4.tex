\textbf{Problem A:} Suppose that a volcano is eruption and readings of the rate $r(t)$ at which solid materials are spewed in the atmosphere are given in the table. The time $t$ is measured in seconds and the units for $r(t)$ are tonnes (metric tons) per second.\\

\begin{tabular}{l | c|c|c|c|c|c|c}
$t$&0&1&2&3&4&5&6\\
\hline
$r(t)$&2&10&12&20&25&35&60\\
\end{tabular}

Give upper and lower estimates for the total quantity of erupted material after 6 seconds.\\


\textbf{Problem B:} The marginal cost of manufacturing $x$ yards of a decorative fabric is $C'(x) = 3-0.02x+0.00006x^2$ where $C'$ is measured in dollars per yard. Find the net increase in cost if the production level is raised from 1000 yards to 2000 yards.
