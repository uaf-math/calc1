\begin{quote}For \emph{all} of the problems below, finding critical points is not enough to complete the problem. You must demonstrate that you have found a minimum or maximum (whichever one you are lookin for..). In addition, you \emph{do} want to make sure you answer the question. (Were you asked for dimensions? area? a point in the $xy$-plane?) \end{quote}

\noindent\S 4.7 \#319, 320, 324, 340, 325, 332*, 339, 343, 348 \\

\begin{quote}*For 332, assume $a,b$ and $d$ are all positive numbers. \textbf{First,} maximize profit. \textbf{Second}, maximize the profit per pizza. \end{quote}

\noindent\textbf{Problem A:} You are going to construct an open-topped box with a square base. You need the box to have a volume of $10 \: m^3.$ The material for the base costs $ \$ 5 / m^2$ and the material for the sides costs $\$ 2 / m^2.$ Find the dimensions of the box that minimize the cost.
