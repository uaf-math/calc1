\quad\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Homework} is due by 11:59PM on the due date. 
\item Turn in your homework via Gradescope. \\
Gradescope is accessed via Canvas. \\
Technology help page: 
\url{https://uaf-math251.github.io/techHelp.html}
\item Numbered problems come from our online textbook:\\ \url{https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-1}\\
\item Frequently Written Homework Assignments will have some added problems not from the text.
\item Complete solutions to all Written Homework problems can be found in out Canvas course under the Assignments tab. 
\item Homework will be graded on completion and effort. \\
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textsc{How to Get Full Credit}
\begin{itemize}
\item Since you have answers and complete solutions to all problems, you are graded based on completion. Thus, \textbf{you should get 100\% on your homework}.
\item You are expected to make grading your homework easy for the graders.
\item Number all problems and all parts of a problem.
\item Write the problems in order.
\item Write legibly and space things so they are easy to find.
\item Follow directions. \textbf{When you are asked for an explanation, make sure to give one!}
\item Turn your homework in on time or in advance. \\
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textsc{Make the Homework into Quiz/Test Prep}
\begin{itemize}
\item Work every problem on every assignment.
\item Attempt all problems at least two days before they are due so that you can ask questions if there is something you don't understand.
\item For each problem, attempt it independently first \textit{before} looking at the answers or getting help of any kind.
\item Star problems you did correctly on the first try. 
\item \emph{Circle} problems where you got help (using solutions, videos, a tutor, etc). You need to practice more problems like the ones you circled in order to be ready for quizzes.
\item \textbf{Understand that if you copy the solutions instead of working the problems on your own, you are sabotaging your chances of success in this and future courses.}
\end{itemize}
