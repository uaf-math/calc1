\heading{Description, Course Goals \& Student Learning Outcomes}
Calculus is one of mathematics' premiere computational tools.  It has
pervasive applications in all the sciences and is part of the UAF core 
curriculum.  The two principal tools of calculus are differentiation and integration. Differentiation concerns how changes in one variable affect another.
How does a population of bacteria change as time changes?  
How does the temperature of the ocean change as depth increases?
Integration, on the other hand, is a kind of reverse process to
differentiation. 

Students completing the course will have the mathematical foundation to be successful in Calculus II and other courses
requiring this background.  Specifically, students will
\begin{clist}
\item understand the role of limits in the definition of a derivative 
and be able to compute elementary derivatives from this definition,
\item understand the definition of a continuous function and identify
continuous/discontinuous functions,
\item develop the skills to compute standard derivatives,
\item be able to apply derivatives to common types of applied problems,
\item understand the definition of the the definite integral,
\item be able to appply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to
compute definite integrals,
\item be able to apply integration to common types of applied problems.
\end{clist}

\heading{Time Commitment}
This is a 4-credit course, which means that a well-prepared student would expect to spend around 12
hours per week actually studying and doing work for this course. (That is, the 12 hours do not include dealing with
technical issues or transportation to a proctoring site.) For students who may be missing substantial
prerequisite content knowledge, the time commitment is greater. The best way to manage a time
commitment of this magnitude is to schedule the hours into your day just as you would a paid job.

\heading{A Typical Week}
All the materials for this course are available online linked either from Canvas or from the public Calculus I webpage. The course is organized as weekly modules in Canvas. Although this is
an online course, it is not a self-paced course. In order to help students stay on track and not get too far behind, there are weekly
deadlines and a grading scheme that rewards timely completion. Within each module, tasks are
organized as daily chunks of work. The daily tasks are to be used as guides---you do not have
to do any task on any particular day with the exception of Proficiencies (2), Midterms (2) and the
Final Exam (1). However, there are regular deadlines, so you must complete tasks by specific days.
Typical workflow for this course is as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Read the weekly announcements and complete the weekly check-in.
\item Spend 1.5 hours working in the ALEKS learning modules, unless you have completed at least 80\% of your ALEKS pie. Optionally, complete a targeted recitation worksheet to practice specific algebra skills needed for the homework assignments for that week.
\item Read the book and/or watch videos (short or long) for each section assigned that week.
\item Work the homework problems for each section assigned that week and check your answers to test your understanding. After you have revised any errors in your homework, upload your homework assignment to Gradescope.
\item Review the topics of the week (ideally including taking a sample quiz) and take the weekly quiz.
\end{itemize}

\heading{Tentative Schedule}
A day-to-day schedule is posted on the course website under
\href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR1jQfLj4vqM_JdgqI6GEhBx_6KHwRRfvfHLL7oCHY_V_xKlNOvP3x7bOT8jx1f6Ge6sDfKTi4mMOQ1/pubhtml}{Schedule (asynchronous section)}. 

This schedule mirrors the tasks for a typical
in-person course. A student is free to organize their time as they choose. The hard deadlines are in
\textcolor{red}{red} in the row labelled Deadlines. These deadlines represent the \textbf{last} day to complete these tasks
and still be considered on time. The daily schedule is set up so that you can stay well ahead of
those deadlines. You should consult this schedule routinely. We may make minor adjustments to
the schedule, which will be announced in advance.

\heading{Office Hours and Communication}
Instructors and TAs will schedule formal office hours, which will be listed on Canvas. Students can also schedule meetings with their instructor outside of regular office hours.

We will use Canvas to send announcements. If we (your instructor/TA) need to contact you, we will send an email to you via Canvas. Thus, you will
want to make sure that the email address in Canvas is one that you check regularly. Note that in
Canvas it is possible to set up text alerts. However, you must login to Canvas and adjust the setting
for your account. Neither email nor text alerts are automatic.

%\heading{Online Course Materials}
%All materials for this course are posted online. See Table \ref{wheretofind}.

\heading{Online Course Materials}
All course materials can be accessed via Canvas. In addition, you will find a wealth of useful material at the public webpage: \href{https://uaf-math251.github.io/}{https://uaf-math251.github.io/}.\\

\heading{Weeks 1 \& 2 Logistics}
The first week of the course is devoted to prerequisite review. Consequently, the homework and quiz mechanics for the first two weeks are different from that of the remainder of the semester.

Instead of the usual written homework, you will be
working with a program called ALEKS to refresh precalculus skills. The first
quiz will be an ALEKS-based assessment. (See \href{https://uaf-math251.github.io/week1-ALEKS.html}{Week 1 Details} for step-by-step instructions.)\\ 
During the first weeks you will:
\begin{clist}
\item enroll in the UAF MATH 251 Spring 2022 Cohort of ALEKS\\
class code: \textbf{VX3AW-T9LNW} %VX3AW-T9LNW
\item complete an initial placement test (approx 1-2 hours) by \textbf{Tuesday August 30} at 11:59pm \\
Finishing the initial placement on time is worth 10 points added to Quiz 1, your proctored ALEKS score.
\item complete 90\% of the ALEKS pie \: OR \: spend 5 hours in Learning Mode by Monday, September 5 at 11:59pm which will count as your first homework grade.
\item complete a \emph{proctored} ALEKS assessment (approx 1-2 hours) on Friday, September 9 which will count as Quiz 1. You will need to set up proctoring for this yourself; instructions are in Canvas.
\end{clist}

\heading{Weekly check-ins}
A weekly check-in will be posted at the beginning of each week to ensure that everyone understands the tasks that need to be completed for that week. You will have unlimited attempts for these check-in activities. Everyone can (and should) earn 100\% of the points in this category.

\heading{Recitations}

Math F251X comes with an attached Math F251L Recitation section. For your recitation activities in the asynchronous class, you are expected to spend that time (1.5 hours) working in ALEKS Learning Mode, unless you have completed 80\% of your ALEKS pie.

In addition, you are encouraged to work on/complete weekly recitation worksheets. These are explicitly devoted to bolstering the underlying non-Calculus skills that are nevertheless essential to success in Calculus such as: graphing, algebra, trigonometry, exponential and logarithmic functions, and inverse functions, and they provide targeted instruction on algebra skills that are needed to complete the weekly homework. They also include strategic homework, quiz, and test prep. These worksheets will not be collected, but I plan to post videos of their completion.
%Beginning week 3, there will be weekly recitation activities. These are explicitly devoted to bolstering the underlying non-Calculus skills that are nevertheless essential to success in Calculus such as: graphing, algebra, trigonometry, exponential and logarithmic functions, and inverse functions. They also include strategic homework, quiz, and test prep. These can be submitted multiple times so students can (and should) earn 100\% of their recitation points. Note: If you score 80\% or higher on the proctored ALEKS assessment, you may opt out of these recitation worksheets. I recommend completing the worksheets regardless of your ALEKS score.

\heading{Homework}
Homework assignments consist of a selection of problems at the end of each section of our textbook. Homework is written (on paper or tablet) and turned in via Gradescope, which may be accessed from Canvas.  Help with scanning homework can be found under \href{https://uaf-math251.github.io/techHelp.html}{Technology Help} on the course webpage. Assignments are due most Mondays and Wednesdays (by 11:59 PM) in advance of the Friday quiz.  Answers to most problems are provided in the back of the book (or linked from the online text). Complete worked solutions to all problems are provided in advance on Canvas. Thus, your homework will be graded based on \emph{effort} and \emph{completion}. Homework can be turned in up to a week late for half-credit. All students should earn 100\% of their homework points!

The list of homework problems and homework guidelines can be found at the \href{https://uaf-math251.github.io/writtenhomework.html}{Homework} link on the course webpage.

Clearly, it is possible to short-circuit the homework by copying the solutions. It should also be clear that (a) this is a bad idea and (b) your instructor and TA will know you have done this. Our goal in providing answers and solutions is to foster the use of homework as a \emph{learning experience}. 

\heading{End of Week Quizzes}
Beginning week 3, there will be a quiz in Gradescope to be completed by the end of the week. This quiz will test
the calculus material that was learned for that week. Each quiz should take you no more than 30 minutes, but you will have 45 minutes to download the quiz, complete it on paper or tablet, and then upload your work as you do for the homework. You will be given the opportunity to submit corrections for incorrect problems.

There are two midterm exams this semester, to be held on the dates
in the schedule on the course website. Note that the course webpage contains all previous Midterms (with solutions) so a student can know in advance what these are like and has lots of opportunity for practice. The midterms are the same 
for all sections; they are prepared and approved by all instructors teaching the course. 

Make-up midterms will be given only for documented excused absences.

\heading{Proficiencies}
A proficiency is an assessment covering a routine mechanical skill.  In
this course we have two of these, one for derivatives and one for 
integrals, on the dates listed in the online schedule. Note that the course webpage contains all previous proficiencies (with solutions) so a student can know in advance what these are like and has lots of opportunity for practice.
Proficiencies will be graded on a binary scale for each problem
(no partial credit).  


The grading structure in this course prioritizes and rewards effort. Students are given the opportunity to retake each proficiency. 

More details will be announced prior to each proficiency.

\heading{Final Exam} 
The cumulative final exam will be held at the day/time listed in the
online schedule. Note that the course webpage contains all previous final exams (with solutions) so a student can know in advance what these are like  and has lots of opportunity for practice.
A make-up final exam will be given only in extenuating circumstances, for documented and excused reasons at the discretion of the instructors.

This course is listed as a General Education Math Course. As such this course is expected to meet the 4 general learning outcomes. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Build knowledge of human institutions, sociocultural processes, and the physical and natural works through the study of mathematics.  Competence will be demonstrated for the foundational information in each subject area, its context and significance, and the methods used in advancing each.

\item Develop intellectual and practical skills across the curriculum, including inquiry and analysis, critical and creative thinking, problem solving, written and oral communication, information literacy, technological competence, and collaborative learning. Proficiency will be demonstrated across the curriculum through critical analysis of proffered information, well-reasoned solutions to problems or inferences drawn from evidence, effective written and oral communication, and satisfactory outcomes of group projects.

\item Acquire tools for effective civic engagement in local through global contexts, including ethical reasoning, intercultural competence, and knowledge of Alaska and Alaska issues.  Facility will be demonstrated through analyses of issues including dimensions of ethics, human and cultural diversity, conflicts and interdependencies, globalization, and sustainability.   

\item Integrate and apply learning, including synthesis and advanced accomplishment across general and specialized studies, adapting them to new settings, questions and responsibilities, and forming a foundation for lifelong learning. Preparation will be demonstrated though production of a a creative or scholarly product that requires broad knowledge, appropriate technical proficiency, information collection, synthesis, interpretation, presentation and reflection.
\end{enumerate}

\subheading{Incomplete Grade} 
Incomplete (I) will only be given in
  DMS courses in cases where
  the student has completed the majority (normally all but the last
  three weeks) of a course with a grade of C or better, but for
  personal reasons beyond his/her control has been unable to complete
  the course during the regular term. Negligence or indifference are
  not acceptable reasons for the granting of an incomplete
  grade. 

\subheading{Late Withdrawals} 
A withdrawal after the deadline
  (currently 9 weeks into the semester) from a DMS course will
  normally be granted only in cases where the student is performing
  satisfactorily (i.e., C or better) in a course, but has exceptional
  reasons, beyond his/her control, for being unable to complete the
  course. These exceptional reasons should be detailed in writing to
  the instructor, department head and dean.

\subheading{No Early Final Examinations}
Final examinations for DMS
  courses shall not be held earlier than the date and time published
  in the official term schedule. Normally, a student will not be
  allowed to take a final exam early. Exceptions can be made by
  individual instructors, but should only be allowed in exceptional
  circumstances and in a manner which doesn't endanger the security of
  the exam.

\subheading{Academic Dishonesty}
Academic dishonesty, including cheating and plagiarism, will not
be tolerated.  It is a violation of the Student Code of Conduct
and will be punished according to UAF procedures.
