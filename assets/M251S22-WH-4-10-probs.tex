\textbf{Problem A:} Solve the initial value problem when $\frac{dy}{dx}=ke^x$ and $y(0)=A$. (Assume $k$ and $A$ are fixed constants.\\

\textbf{Problem B:} A projectile is shot vertically upward from a point 2 meters above ground level. If the velocity of the projectile is given by $v(t)=24 -9.8t$ where $t$ is measured in seconds after launch and $v$ is measured in meters per second, find an equation for the position of the projectile and use that equation to determine the height of the projectile 2 seconds after launch.
