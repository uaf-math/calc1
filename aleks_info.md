You are going to ALEKS PPL assessment which will consist of about 30 questions. You will have 2 hours to complete it. 

ALEKS is an online tool for assessing precalculus content knowledge. The ALEKS tool is **adaptive**, which means that the questions you are asked are determined, in part, by your answers to previous questions. 

The reason you are taking this assessment is to help you have a better sense of your strengths and areas for improvement. The assessment will also help the Calculus I teaching team (instructors and TA's) have a better understanding of how to provide extra support.

The score on your ALEKS quiz will be averaged with your score on the paper-and-pencil Quiz 1. This average will be the first quiz score in your Quiz Average.

Taking the ALEKS assessment **replaces** the Tuesday September 3 Recitation.
