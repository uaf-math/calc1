##  <span style="color:blue">ALEKS Quiz Info for In-Person Students</span>

You are going to ALEKS PPL assessment which will consist of about 30 questions. You will have 2 hours to complete it. 

ALEKS is an online tool for assessing precalculus content knowledge. The ALEKS tool is **adaptive**, which means that the questions you are asked are determined, in part, by your answers to previous questions. 

The reason you are taking this assessment is to help you have a better sense of your strengths and areas for improvement. The assessment will also help the Calculus I teaching team (instructors and TA's) have a better understanding of how to provide extra support.

For in-person sections, taking the ALEKS assessment **replaces** the Tuesday, 21 January Recitation.

## How to first log into ALEKS PPL.

If you want to login to ALEKS in advance of your proctored ALEKS, the directions are below. The advantage of logging into ALEKS in advance is to make things faster on the day of the assessment or to fix any login issues (like forgetting your password). It is not mandatory that you login ahead of time, but it is strongly recommended!

1. Go to the [ALEKS sign up page](https://www.aleks.com/sign_up)
 
2. Enter our class code: **QUJAE-HVHMA**

3. ALEKS will then direct you through the registration process. **Write down your login name and password** as you will need them for the proctored assessment which will use a different computer.

4. Now that you have logged in to ALEKS PPL, it will give you a tutorial on how to use the interface and you are done with the setup.

NOTE: You will not be able to start your assessment without a password.
