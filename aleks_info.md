##  <span style="color:blue">ALEKS Quiz Info for In-Person Students</span>

You are going to ALEKS PPL assessment which will consist of about 30 questions. You will have 2 hours to complete it. 

ALEKS is an online tool for assessing precalculus content knowledge. The ALEKS tool is **adaptive**, which means that the questions you are asked are determined, in part, by your answers to previous questions. 

The reason you are taking this assessment is to help you have a better sense of your strengths and areas for improvement. The assessment will also help the Calculus I teaching team (instructors and TA's) have a better understanding of how to provide extra support.

For in-person sections, taking the ALEKS assessment **replaces** the Tuesday, 21 January Recitation.
