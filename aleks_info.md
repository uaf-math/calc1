##  <span style="color:blue">Background</span>

You are going to ALEKS PPL assessment. ALEKS is an online tool for assessing precalculus content knowledge. Your assessment will consist of about 30 questions and you will have 2 hours to complete it.

The ALEKS tool is **adaptive**, which means that the questions you are asked are determined, in part, by your answers to previous questions. 

The reason you are taking this assessment is to help you have a better sense of your strengths and areas to improve and to help the Calculus I teaching team (instructors and TA's) have a clear understanding of how best to provide extra support.

The score on your ALEKS quiz will be averaged with your score on the paper-and-pencil Quiz 1. This average will be the first quiz score in your Quiz Average.

Taking the ALEKS assessment **replaces** the Tuesday September 3 Recitation.

    Class announcements and group discussion outside of class time will occur over Campuswire.  You will need a PIN to sign up; the PIN is in [Blackboard](http://classes.alaska.edu).

### Sort out how to print and scan your work to upload 

There will be a lot of uploading of work you do on paper into Gradescope. You will need to sort out a mechanism to do this.

- For the Written Homework, you will need to write out each problem statement and do your work on your own paper, and then scan upload your problems to Gradescope in the appropriate area.
- For the weekly Quizzes, you will need to download the PDF from Gradescope, print it out (or work on a tablet or computer), scan it, and then upload it back to Gradescope, within the allotted time.

See the [Tech Help](techHelp) section for tips.

## Week 1 Logistics

From the [schedule](assets/general/Spring2021/MATH251-Schedule.pdf) you can see that in Week 1 there are a few things to do.

- Your first recitation is Tuesday.  The Zoom link is in [Blackboard](https://classes.alaska.edu). You will complete a worksheet in groups during this first recitation; most weeks it will be devoted to homework help, quiz prep, and the quiz.
- Your first [WebAssign](webassign) homework is due Thursday, but try to submit it by Wednesday to allow time for troubleshooting.
