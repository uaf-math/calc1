# <span style="color:blue">Welcome to the homepage for MATH 251 Calculus I in Fall 2020. </span> 

## Getting Started

* A great place to start is to read the [syllabus](assets/general/Fall2020/MATH251-Syllabus-F2020-generic.pdf).

* You will have regular assignments in [WebAssign](https://webassign.net/). Information about how to log on for the first time can be found at the [WebAssign](webassign) menu item on the left. **Access Webassign through Blackboard.**

You gain access to an electronic copy of our textbook via WebAssign.

* Log into [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/153557) and complete Quiz 0. This will let you practice downloading, completing, scanning/photoscanning and uploading materials. (You can also access Gradescope through Blackboard.)

* Check out the day-to-day [schedule](assets/general/Fall2020/MATH251-Schedule.pdf).  (All dates are subject to change!)

* More information is available on the [Getting Started](week1) page.

#### Synchronous sections (FXA and FXB)



<!--* See the [Week 1](week1) menu item to get started with the ALEKS PPL (placement, preparation, and learning) test.  You need to log in to ALEKS by Tuesday, January 14.  You will need to either complete 10 hours or 90% of your pie in ALEKS PPL's learning mode by the end of the day of Monday, January 20.

## Keeping up to date

* Check the [schedule](assets/general/Fall2020/Math251-Schedule.pdf) regularly.

* Before each day's synchronous class, complete the [Daily Homework](writtenhomework) and upload your problems to Gradescope. 
<!--Do the problems on the next [Written Homework](writtenhomework).  (You will not turn in Written Homework, but it should be completed by the due dates shown on the [schedule](assets/general/Spring2020/M251-Spring-2020-Schedule-addendum.pdf).)  Solutions are at [BlackBoard](https://classes.alaska.edu). -->

* Make progress on [WebAssign](https://webassign.net/) problems as often as you can, and don't lose track of when they are due. 

* Introductory videos and longer videos for each section are available on [BlackBoard](https://classes.alaska.edu). Watch any time! Make sure to watch the short intro videos before each class period to prepare for the [worksheets](materials).

* [Quizzes](quizzes) are timed and online and will be retrieved and uploaded through [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/153557).  

* Find examples of previous [Quizzes](quizzes) and [Exams](exams), with solutions, on the tabs at left.

* Grades and videos are at [BlackBoard](https://classes.alaska.edu).

<!--### <span style="color:orange">CURRENT PLAN 3/25:</span>

> * The [Syllabus has been updated](assets/general/Spring2020/MATH251-Syllabus-S2020-addendum.pdf) with new information about how your grade will be calculated.  (The [original Syllabus is here](assets/general/Spring2020/MATH251-Syllabus-S2020-generic.pdf).)
>
> * An [updated schedule](assets/general/Spring2020/M251-Spring-2020-Schedule-addendum.pdf) has been posted.  (For reference only, the [original schedule is here](assets/general/Spring2020/M251-Spring-2020-Schedule.pdf).)
>
> *  In-person lectures will be replaced by online videos and guided activities.  Links to these videos are at [BlackBoard](https://classes.alaska.edu).  See the _Spring 2020 Videos_ tab at Blackboard, and please read the "best practices" notice first.  These video lectures will point-out which Written Homework problems you should do to check your understanding.  This content replaces (as much as we can) our in-person worksheets.
>
> * Additional materials, including videos, are available and organized by section.  See the _Fall 2017 Class Videos_ tab at [BlackBoard](https://classes.alaska.edu).  Worksheets and their solutions, for all upcoming sections, are at the [In-class materials from Fall 2019](inclass-stuff-fall-2019) page.
>
> * In-person recitations with Dakota are cancelled.
>
> * Instructors (Jill & Ed) and teaching assistant (Dakota) will have online office hours through Zoom or Google Hangouts (above).
>
> * [WebAssign](https://webassign.net/) due dates have been adjusted to match the updated schedule.  As usual, [WebAssign homework (WA)](https://webassign.net/) is due by 11PM on the due date.
>
> * [Written Homework (WRH)](writtenhomework) is no longer turned in for a grade.  However, any student who intends to pass this class must still work every problem by the due date.  See the completion dates on the updated schedule.
>
> * [Quizzes](quizzes) are now take-home.  Blank Quizzes will be posted on [BlackBoard](https://classes.alaska.edu) on Tuesday morning at 8 am (AK time).  They are due Wednesday by 5 pm (AK time), but we expect most students to complete them by the end of the day Tuesday.  No late quizzes will be accepted!  Students should scan or photograph or save their work as a PDF.  Quizzes will be corrected, but the grade will be assigned based on completion and effort.
>
> * These plans are necessarily tentative, in part because guidance from the UA administration is evolving.  We will update the information here as things become clear.
