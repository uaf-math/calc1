title: Math F251 Calculus I at UAF
---

### Welcome!

This is the central website for all in-person sections of Calculus I 
taught by the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.uaf.edu/dms)
at the [University of Alaska Fairbanks](http://www.uaf.edu).

### This site is still under construction for Fall 2021

* Note that because Calculus I is coordinated at UAF, the course does not change much from one semester to the next. So you can see now what typical quizzes, tests and the final will look like using the menu on the left.

* The [Math & Stat Tutoring Lab](https://www.uaf.edu/dms/mathlab/index.php) is closed for in-person tutoring but is open for online tutoring!  You can [sign up for online tutoring](https://fairbanks.go-redrock.com/).

### What is different for Fall 2021

- Free online textbook: [OpenStax Calculus Volume I](https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-1)
- Free student solutions manual: [Student Resources](https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-1?Student%20resources)
